FIN - PowerShell Enhancement Suite

## DESCRIPTION

`fin` is a collection of functions, aliases, and tools that provide a more
powerful and user-friendly PowerShell experience, inspired by features from the
Fish shell. It includes enhanced navigation, better history management, and a
host of useful utility commands.

This help file is displayed when you run `man fin`. For information on other
aliased commands (like `ls`, `grep`, `cat`), use `man` on the specific command
(e.g., `man ls`), which will call the standard PowerShell `Get-Help`.

## DIRECTORY HISTORY

Fin maintains a persistent history of directories you visit, allowing you to
navigate back and forth easily.

COMMANDS:
  - fin
    Displays the entire directory history with indices. The current directory
    is marked with "->".

  - fin [index]
    Navigates to the directory at the specified index in the history.

  - n (next)
    Navigates forward to the next directory in the history.

  - p (previous)
    Navigates backward to the previous directory in the history.

  - cd -
    Switches to the previously visited directory (a quick toggle).

  - .., ..., ....
    Quickly navigate up 1, 2, or 3 parent directories.

## COMMAND HISTORY

The standard `history` command is enhanced to provide access to both the
current session's history and the full, persisted history log from PSReadLine.

COMMANDS:
  - history
    Shows the command history for the current PowerShell session. Accepts the
    same parameters as `Get-History`.

  - history -f
    Shows the full, unfiltered command history from the PSReadLine log file.
    This includes commands from previous sessions.

  - full-history
    A convenient alias for `history -f`.

## CORE UTILITIES

  - reload
    Reloads your PowerShell profile, applying any changes made to it or to the
    fin.ps1 script itself.

  - sysinfo
    Displays a summary of system information, including CPU, memory, USB, and
    PCI devices.

  - weather [location] [-Forecast]
    Shows the weather for a specified location, or your auto-detected location.
    Use the -Forecast switch to see a multi-day forecast.

  - math "[expression]"
    A simple command-line calculator. The expression must be in a string.
    Example: math "5 * (2 + 3)"

  - funced [function_name]
    Opens a function's definition in a temporary file in Notepad for editing
    in the current session.

  - funcsave [function_name]
    Saves a function from the current session to your $PROFILE, making it
    permanent.

## SHIMMED COMMANDS

Fin provides PowerShell-native versions of many common Unix/Linux commands.
These "shims" will intelligently use the PowerShell version if the native
command is not available.

Some of the available commands include:
`awk`, `cat`, `cp`, `curl`, `date`, `df`, `dig`, `du`, `grep`, `head`, `ip`,
`ls`, `man`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `netstat`, `ping`, `ps`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `sed`,
`tail`, `tar`, `touch`, `tr`, `wc`, `wget`, `which`
